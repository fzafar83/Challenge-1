Challenge-1 : Code refactor



**Description** : HTML, CSS, Git challenge : Code refactor.  My motivation during this challenge was to learn how to refactor using the HTML, CSS, and git . Purpose of this challenge was to improve the accessibility standards of a webpage. I learned how to replace the non-semantic elements with the semantic elements without changing the layout of the actual webpage. I also made some structural changes while removing the extra classes in HTML, removing and consolidating the class selectors in CSS.

**The user story**: 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


**Acceptance criteria:**
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

**installation**
This challenge was performed after creating a repository in the Github, by copying files from the class "develop" folder in the activity repository, pasting them in our directory created in the challenge folder, Opening the Challenge in the VS code, refactoring the code and launching the webpage to check the accessibility standards.
